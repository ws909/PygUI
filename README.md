This is one of my projects from my early days of programming.
I don't see a great deal of value in this, however, somebody expressed an interest in it a while ago, and suggested I upload it to GitHub.
I don't really intend for this repository to live on in any way. I have long abandoned it. It was a fun learning experience, though.

The project consists of a GUI framework named PyGUI, as well as a test application, under the "Content" directory.
It was never under source control, and only intended as a fun side project for a short while, so the quality is thereafter.
